+ [NLP Task: Clap along If You Know What Happiness Is to You -- How Different Groups of People Feel Happy?](https://github.com/wang1558/ADS-Projects/tree/master/Project1%20NLP%20Task)
    + Built statistical models to analyze more than 100,000 expressions regarding emotions and activities which made people happy.
    + Generated pie charts and histograms to compare the frequency of happiness based on genders and 7 happiness contributors.
    + Created word clouds, network plots and bar plots to explore how marital status influenced the keywords of happiness.
    + Preprocessed data by using natural language processing (NLP) methods to create corpus of cleaned data for data analysis.

+ [Shiny App: Live a Green Life in New York City](https://github.com/wang1558/ADS-Projects/tree/master/Project2%20Shiny%20App)
    + Extracted leaflet package to visualize 59 NYC community air quality based on rental prices, citibike stations, and garden locations.
    + Implemented air quality comparisons and rental prices comparisons among community districts using parallel coordinates plot.
    + Gathered and cleaned data by removing unnecessary items and adding geographic information using Google Cloud.

+ [Predictive Modeling: Images Super Resolution](https://github.com/wang1558/ADS-Projects/tree/master/Project3%20SuperResolution)
    + Constructed feature extraction and super-resolution functions.
    + Applied gradient boosting and XGBoosting models in image super-resolution.
    + Obtained the advanced model with PSNR 25.83 and 43.611s model training time.
    
+ [Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Post-processing Algorithms and Evaluation](https://github.com/wang1558/ADS-Projects/tree/master/Project4%20OCR%20Post-processing)
    + Implemented OCR error detection and correction and improved word-wise precision and recall over 100 documents by 7.5%.
    + Constructed confusion matrix representing probabilities of character errors by using training set and used it as part of correction.
    + Performed topic modeling by optimizing the number of topics and applying LDA to compute the scores as the correction method.
